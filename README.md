Tools for managing my fantasy football draft and team. It's a standalone program that's run from the command-line and works off of static text files (for now). 

Right now, all that's present is basic code for managing a draft.

2013 Season
-----------

This branch, 'season2013', contains my updates in preparation for the 2013/2014 NFL season.  

Most of the code here is based on the "default" ESPN FF League rules.  Some work would be required to adapt the code to handle other or modified league rules.


Known Issues / To Do
====================

* Handle bye-weeks for players
* Strategic decisions based on previous choices by other players
* Update the model (move to a sampling/stochastic system?) for the other players draft choices
* Understand the effect of matchups on offensive/defensive players
